# History

## Pre-Context (Scene 1)

### The Runaway Gladiator
- A famed gladiator led a slave uprising that swept through border towns and supply routes.
- The rebellion was crushed with mass crucifixions along imperial roads, a public warning to slaves and rivals.
- Neighboring powers cite the brutality as proof that Aurelia’s rule has decayed into spectacle and fear.

### The Assassinated Dictator
- A prior strongman seized the city during a crisis, consolidating power through emergency decrees.
- He was executed by the ruling elite after order returned, but his supporters still venerate him.
- His death left a vacuum: the elite claim moral restoration while quietly relying on his precedent of cruelty.

### Political Tensions

- **Neighboring Civilizations:** Rival city-states frame Aurelia as decadent and unstable, debating sanctions, trade pressure, or proxy unrest.
- **Ruling Elite:** Divided between pragmatic hardliners who favor terror and cautious reformers concerned about legitimacy.
- **Religions:** A persecuted cult spreads quietly among the poor, preaching moral purity and a single creator, challenging state orthodoxy.
- **Slaves:** Fear and resentment intensify after the crucifixions, fueling rumors of liberation and sympathy for the cult’s message.
