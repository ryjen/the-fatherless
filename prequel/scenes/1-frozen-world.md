## **EXT. TUNDRA CAMP – DAY**

Wind slices across a white plain. A small ring of huts huddles around a single fire.
Hunters return with little to show. Children watch the flames as if they are alive.

**HUNTER:**
"The herds are gone."

**ELDER:**
"Then we guard the fire with our breath."

## **EXT. HUNTING GROUNDS – DAY**

Two clans face each other across a frozen stream. Spears are raised, then lowered.
The land offers too little to fight for long.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Survival as faith**: Fire is life, memory, and identity.
* **Scarcity as pressure**: Hunger drives conflict.
* **A world at the edge**: The north grows unforgiving.
