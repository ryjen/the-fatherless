## **EXT. CLAN GATHERING – DAY**

Hunters argue around a central fire. Some point north, others toward the sun.

**HUNTER:**
"We stay. The spirits know this place."

**ATUUN:**
"The Sky-Fire was not wrath. It was direction."

Silence follows. The fire crackles between them like a judgment.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Revelation vs. tradition**: The tribe resists change.
* **Leadership tested**: Atuun must persuade, not command.
* **Faith contested**: The fire becomes a dividing line.
