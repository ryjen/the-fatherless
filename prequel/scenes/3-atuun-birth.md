## **INT. ICE CAVERN – NIGHT**

A narrow cave glows with firelight. Midwives cradle a newborn as the sky burns outside.
The child exhales a thin cloud of breath into the cold.

**SPIRIT ELDER:**
"A leader has been ignited from the fury of the heavens."

The elders place a coal near the infant’s hand.

**ELDER:**
"Atuun."

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Destiny without lineage**: A child born to a sign, not a throne.
* **Fire as naming**: The sky and the flame share a bond.
* **Myth begins**: The fatherless spark is lit.
