## **INT. ELDER CIRCLE – NIGHT**

A ring of elders sits around a low fire. Atuun kneels with a carved bone map.

**ATUUN:**
"We were born of warmth. Why do we die in ice?"

The eldest traces a faint line in the ash.

**ELDEST:**
"There was a south. Rivers. Green. We forgot."

Atuun looks into the flame, as if seeing that land.

Fade out.
