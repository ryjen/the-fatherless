## **EXT. ICE PLAIN – DAWN**

A small band stands ready with packs and spears. Atuun carries a clay bowl with embers.
The rest of the clan watches in silence.

**MOTHER:**
"If you leave, you may never return."

**ATUUN:**
"If we stay, we never live."

The band turns south, footprints filling with snow behind them.

Fade out.
