## **EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS – NIGHT**

A blizzard swallows the path. The embers dim under the wind.
Atuun shields the flame with his cloak, hands blistering from heat.

**COMPANION:**
"Let it die, or we die."

**ATUUN:**
"If it dies, we all die."

The storm breaks. The fire survives.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Fire preserved**: The symbol of life nearly vanishes.
* **Leadership by sacrifice**: Atuun suffers to keep hope alive.
* **Nature as adversary**: The world resists the journey.
