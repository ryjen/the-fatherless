# **Prequel Summary — *The Fatherless: Age of Embers***

**Year ~21,760 BCE.**
Earth is locked in the **late Pleistocene ice age** (the previous age of Pisces to Sael).
Europe is a continent of white desolation—endless tundra, violent winds, and predators larger, faster, and better adapted than the humans who cling to survival. What is now France is an unforgiving frozen plain where food is scarce, tools are primitive, and death is constant.

**Africa—the cradle of life—is a place of lush vegitation and abundant water**. Humans populations can overbalance existence with apex predators.
Tribes of humans fight for rights to known places of survival - and have pushed other tribes north into France.

Humans live and die by fire.
They fight to keep it alive more fiercely than they fight beasts.
Fire is not warmth—it is **identity**, **memory**, **spirit**.

In this age, gods are not worshipped for salvation but feared as elemental forces. And none is feared more than the **Sky-Fire**, a wrathful deity associated with lightning, auroras, and the sun.

### **The Day the Sky Burned**

On the night of the winter solstice, as cold winds carve through camps and predators stalk the treeline, the sky over southern Europe **ignites**.

A massive **solar flare** tears across the atmosphere.
Auroras shimmer blood-red.
The firmament glows like **a dome of fire**.

The people believe the Sky-Fire god has awakened in anger.

That night, in a hidden cavern deep beneath the ice cliffs of ancient France, a child is born during the blazing heavens. His first breath coincides with a burst of blinding light across the sky. The midwives fall to their knees. The clan's spiritual elder declares:

**“A leader has been ignited from the fury of the heavens.”**

They name him **Atuun**—
*the one caught between fire and night.*

### **The Prophecy of Return**

Atuun grows into a strange, resilient, and intuitive boy. He survives dangers no child should, speaks with an uncanny calm, and senses shifts in weather and migrations long before the hunters do.

But his greatest strength is his mind. He begins to question why the people remain in this freezing wasteland. He studies cave art, animal bones, ice patterns, stars. He listens to the elders who speak of a golden land far to the south where rivers once fed forests—**Africa**, the ancestral home.

Atuun becomes convinced that the Sky-Fire’s blazing omen was not wrath, but **instruction**:

**The people must return.**

### **A Leader Shaped by Fire**

As Atuun reaches adolescence, the clans face catastrophe—
mammoth herds begin to vanish, winters grow longer, predators more desperate. Starvation looms.

Atuun gathers scattered tribes and teaches them new ways to hunt, preserve fire, craft tools, and interpret the land. He unites groups long hostile to each other, forming the earliest proto-civilization.

His message spreads:

**“We were born of warmth.
We must return to it.”**

Atuun leads them south on a generational journey across alpine ice, desertifying plains, and dangerous migrations toward the cradle of humanity.

The path is brutal.
Many die.
But Atuun becomes more myth than man—
a symbol of survival in the harshest age.

### **The Birth of a Cycle**

Atuun eventually guides the remnants of humanity back to Africa, re-establishing populations in the fertile regions that begin to bloom again as climate cycles shift.

His teachings evolve into the earliest philosophies of unity, migration, and the sanctity of life—ideas later distorted, forgotten, remembered, and reborn in later ages.

Thousands of years later, Sael’s cult will see Atuun as **the first fatherless leader**—not literally, but symbolically: one whose destiny came not from lineage or privilege, but from **the fire in the sky**.

Just as Sael will represent forgiveness…
Atuun represents **human resilience**—
the spark that keeps the species alive through catastrophe.

The trilogy’s mythology now spans:

* **Atuun — Age of Embers** (Prequel): survival
* **Sael — The Fatherless** (Main story): morality
* **Neurion — Age of Tomorrow** (Sequel): transcendence

Three eras. Three kinds of “birth.”
One long human myth about what guides us through darkness.
