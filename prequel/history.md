# History

## Pre-Context (Scene 1)

### The Ice Age Crisis
- Late Pleistocene Europe is locked in deep cold, with prey vanishing and winters lengthening.
- Tribes fight over shrinking hunting grounds, driving weaker groups into harsher northern lands.
- Fire becomes the center of survival, memory, and identity.

### The Sky-Fire Omen
- A massive solar flare lights the winter sky, interpreted as the Sky-Fire god’s awakening.
- The omen is feared as wrath, but later read by Atuun as instruction.
- The event fractures belief: some cling to fear, others seek meaning.

### Tribal Pressures
- **Elders:** Guard tradition, fearing that migration will erase identity.
- **Hunters:** Demand immediate survival solutions, resisting untested visions.
- **Families:** Torn between safety in the known and the promise of warmth.
- **Outcast Tribes:** Scattered groups on the margins, ready to follow a unifying leader.
