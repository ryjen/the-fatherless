Drafting references: [drafting/screenplay-scenes-1-5.md](../drafting/screenplay-scenes-1-5.md), [drafting/screenplay-outline.md](../drafting/screenplay-outline.md)

**Location:** Aurelian elite palace, golden hall, torches flickering, long table of rulers and advisors.

**Action / Story Beats:**

* The ruling class discusses growing **external threats**, specifically a **cult in the city** gaining influence among commoners.
* They mock the cult’s moral critiques of the empire, claiming that **Aurelian rulers are all inbred and too cruel to rule**, reinforcing their elitist sense of superiority.
* Debate turns to the runaway gladiator slave whose army was **crucified mile by mile** along the country after capture.
* Neighboring kings view this as excessive, questioning Aurelian morality; rulers argue that Aurelia’s brutality is justified, but some fear external judgment.
* The senators have recently executed a popular leader for brutal takeover of Aurelia; his baldness a sign of the kings contempt for indulgance
* Cassian visibly winces, morally disgusted:
  **Cassian:** “That is outrageous. We have rules… even for slaves. This… this is madness.”
* Elite rulers laugh dismissively, showing the **gap between cruelty and conscience**.
* Cassian exchanges a quick, tense glance with a silent aide, foreshadowing his later manipulation of Sael’s birth.

**Camera / Visuals:**

* **Wide shot:** Entire hall, golden opulence, long table with rulers in lavish garb.
* **Close-ups:** Faces of the rulers, smirking; Cassian’s face, a mixture of disgust and tension.
* **Lighting:** Flickering torchlight, shadows creating a sense of moral darkness behind the grandeur.
* **Symbolism:** Shows **elite decadence**, **normalized cruelty**, and introduces Cassian’s inner conflict.

**Tone / Feel:**

* Opulent but morally corrupt, juxtaposing grandeur with the seeds of cruelty.
* Sets political stakes, showing how public and private cruelty are intertwined.
