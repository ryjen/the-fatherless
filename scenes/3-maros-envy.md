# **Scene 3 – Maro’s Envy (Detailed Cinematic Version)**

**Location:** Cassian’s House / Slave Quarters
**Time:** Late Night, after Scene 2

---

## **INT. CASSIAN’S HOUSE – MAIN HALL – NIGHT**

A long, dim corridor of polished stone floors and cold statues. The air still carries the distant echoes of Cassian’s drunken laughter and the fading sounds of the elite orgy from earlier.

**Maro** stands near the doorway, smoothing his simple tunic, ashamed yet longing for the world beyond the threshold. He watched the nobles pass earlier—perfumed, laughing, touching each other without shame.

He touches his own lips, pretending for a moment he were part of that world.

He isn’t.

A guard approaches and Maro instantly straightens.

**GUARD:**
*(mocking)*
Back to the quarters, pet. The master’s done with his pleasures.

The guard leaves. Maro swallows the insult.

---

## **INT. LEDGER ROOM – NIGHT**

A small side chamber lit by a single oil lamp. Scrolls and wooden tablets stacked high.
Cassian left in a drunken hurry earlier; the room is a mess.

Maro hesitates, then slips inside.

He scans the room—ledgers open, names of slaves, births, deaths, family ties. Something he has never been allowed to read.

His fingers trace the lists.

**MARO (whisper whisper):**
*My mother… no name. My father… no name. Just property.*

He flips through to the new entry Cassian marked tonight.

A highlighted entry:

**“NARA — mother”**
**“DARVEN — son”**
**“Permission granted for conception: Reward for service.”**

There is no note that they are related. Only the master knows.

Maro freezes.

He understands what he’s seeing
—yet at first, he misunderstands it.

---

## **Maro’s Internal Conflict**

### **Layer 1: Envy**

His face tightens.

**MARO (to himself):**
“They… get a reward? They get a child?”

His eyes well with jealousy.

Slaves rarely receive permission to form families.
Most die never knowing love.

And Maro—
young, attractive, desired by masters for their pleasures—
has never been allowed intimacy from his own kind.

To see these two granted a privilege he secretly longed for
hits him like a blade.

---

### **Layer 2: Confusion**

Maro reads deeper.

He sees the ages. The shared bloodline hints.

**MARO (whisper):**
“They’re… related? Why would Cassian…?”

He frowns.
He feels sick.

---

### **Layer 3: Horror**

Then it hits him.

This wasn’t a reward.
This was humiliation.
A joke.
A cruelty.

He stumbles backward, gripping the table.

**MARO:**
“Oh gods… he made them do it. He made them…”

He can’t finish the thought.

The lamp flickers violently as a wind sweeps through the halls—distant, howling, like the city itself is ashamed.

---

## **INT. SLAVE QUARTERS – NIGHT**

Maro walks through sleeping bodies. He looks at Darven—the son—sleeping innocently, unaware of the cruelty committed against him.

He looks at Nara—the mother—resting after the forced “privilege.”
She is trembling in her sleep, as though her spirit already knows something is very wrong.

Maro kneels near them but doesn’t dare wake them.

---

## **Maro’s Emotional Break**

He whispers:

**MARO:**
*Why them? Why not… me? Why not my chance at something real?*

He feels disgust at himself for feeling envy for something born from brutality.

But then—

He feels something else.

**Guilt.**
**Love for his own kind.**
**Fear of the cruelty being repeated.**

---

## **INT. LEDGER ROOM – LATE NIGHT**

Maro returns. He stares at the ledger marked with Cassian’s personal sigil—proof of the arranged conception.

He picks up the tablet with trembling hands.

**MARO (whisper):**
*This must never happen again.*

He tucks it under his tunic.

---

## **EXT. BACK ALLEY BEHIND CASSIAN’S HOUSE – NIGHT**

Cold air. Dark alley. A secret door in the wall.

Maro knocks three times. Then twice. A coded pattern.

The door opens a crack.

A hooded figure — **A Cult Acolyte** — peers out.

**ACOLYTE:**
*(whispers)*
“You again?”

**MARO:**
*(voice shaking)*
“I bring knowledge… something terrible. Something that must be stopped.”

He holds out the tablet.

The acolyte’s eyes widen.

A second cultist appears behind him.

**CULTIST #2:**
“This is his writing… Cassian’s hand.”

Maro nods.

**MARO:**
“He mocked them. Used them. The child they conceive tonight…
you must protect it.
Please.
I don’t know why…
but I feel it.”

He puts a hand to his chest.

**MARO:**
“I feel… it matters.”

---

## **The Turning Point**

The cultists exchange uneasy glances.

One of them takes the tablet.

**ACOLYTE:**
“We will bring this to the Elders at sunrise.
If what you say is true…
this child may be more important than the master intended.”

The door shuts.

Maro stands alone in the dark, shaking.

He has no idea that he has just altered the fate of the empire
—and the moral foundation of the next age.

The camera closes in on Maro’s face.

Conflicted.
Ashamed.
Relieved.
And unknowingly…
the first protector of future Sael.
