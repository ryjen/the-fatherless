# **Scene 21 – The Crucifixion**

**Location:** Aurelian streets / road to Avarim camp
**Time:** Day

---

## **EXT. CITY GATES – DAY**

The gates open. A procession spills into the streets.
Sael carries the wooden beam across his shoulders, crown of thorns pressed into his brow.

Soldiers flank him. The crowd swells and recoils, a living tide.
No words from Sael—only breath, steady and thin.

---

## **THE PARADE**

The procession winds through narrow alleys and open squares.

Faces pass in close-up:
* A woman weeping in silence.
* A boy lifting his hand, unsure whether to wave or hide.
* A soldier gripping his spear too tightly.

Maro walks far behind, hood low, eyes locked on Sael’s back.

## **THE MOMENT**

The hill rises. The parade slows.

Sael stumbles once. A guard pushes him forward.
He regains his footing, jaw set, eyes fixed on the horizon.

---

## **THE CRUCIFIXION**

The act is swift—hands bound, ropes tightened, the beam lifted.

No speech. No plea. Only the creak of wood and the rush of wind.

The crowd falls into a hush that feels like guilt.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Sael hangs against the sky, crown of thorns dark against the light.
Below, the parade disperses, leaving dust and silence behind.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Spectacle over speech**: The parade carries the message more than words.
* **Silent mercy**: Sael’s restraint becomes his final testimony.
* **Public witness**: The city is forced to look.
