# **Scene 20 – Cult and Sael Decide**

**Location:** Cult headquarters / outskirts of Aurelia
**Time:** Night

---

## **INT. CULT HEADQUARTERS – NIGHT**

The inner chamber is crowded. Elders and disciples form a half-circle.
The air is tight with fear and resolve.

Maro steps forward, bruised and unsteady, but upright.

**MARO:**
"Cassian has forced their hand. They will make a spectacle of him."

Whispers. A young disciple clenches a fist.

**DISCIPLE NORA (urgent):**
"Then we answer with conviction. Let the city see the truth in his mercy."

Across the room, another disciple shakes his head.

**DISCIPLE JOREN (low, wary):**
"And what if they see only blood?"

## **THE PLEA**

Maro turns to Sael, voice breaking.

**MARO:**
"Your sacrifice is the only way to show Aurelia its sin."

He looks down, ashamed.

**MARO:**
"I brought you into this storm. Let me not lose you for nothing."

Sael listens, calm, absorbing the weight of the room.

## **THE DIVISION**

Sahmia steps forward, eyes steady.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"We will not all agree. But we must not fracture."

A murmur of assent—some reluctant, some resolute.

Sael raises his hand and the chamber stills.

---

## **THE DECISION**

**SAEL:**
"If my life can bind this truth to their hearts, then I accept."

He looks to those who doubt.

**SAEL:**
"Not because death is holy, but because mercy must be seen."

The room bows its head, grief mixing with purpose.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Sael stands alone near the doorway, the night beyond him.
Maro remains beside him, eyes wet, unworthy but trusted.

The candles flicker as if in agreement.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Division and unity**: The cult wavers, but the mission holds.
* **Sacrifice as witness**: Sael chooses to make mercy visible.
* **Maro’s burden**: Guilt becomes a plea for redemption.
