**Location:** Aurelian streets / market road
**Time:** Day

---

## **EXT. MARKET ROAD – DAY**

The street is crowded, hot with dust and noise. Vendors shout. Children weave through stalls.
Sael walks among them, quiet, unarmed. **MARO** stays close, scanning faces.

Two men argue over a spilled basket of grain. The younger grabs the older by the collar.

**YOUNGER MAN:**
"You ruined me!"

The older man swings, striking back. The crowd stiffens, bracing for violence.

## **THE FORGIVENESS**

Sael steps between them, hands open.

**SAEL:**
"Enough."

The younger man spits at his feet.

**YOUNGER MAN:**
"Who are you to stop us?"

Sael looks at him, calm.

**SAEL:**
"No one. That is why I can forgive you."

The younger man falters, confused. Sael turns to the older man.

**SAEL:**
"And you."

The older man’s fists loosen. He steps back.

Sael kneels, gathering the scattered grain into the basket. He offers it back without a word.

The two men look at one another, then lower their eyes.

## **THE CHANGE**

A hush spreads through the market. The tension loosens as if a rope has been cut.
The younger man bows his head.

**YOUNGER MAN (quiet):**
"I should have asked."

The older man nods once, ashamed.

**OLDER MAN:**
"And I should have answered."

The crowd exhales. A small child laughs, breaking the spell.

## **THE HARASSMENT**

Two Aurelian guards push through the onlookers, scowling.

**GUARD:**
"Move along. No gatherings."

Maro steps forward, deflecting with a respectful bow.

**MARO:**
"We were only settling a dispute."

The guard’s eyes narrow, then slide past Sael.

**GUARD:**
"Keep it small."

They move on. The crowd disperses slowly, whispering.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Sael looks at Maro, a faint nod between them.
Maro gestures toward the next street, guiding him onward.

Behind them, the two men lift the basket together.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Forgiveness as a public act**: Mercy interrupts violence and redirects the crowd.
* **Influence without force**: Sael changes the moment by refusing power.
* **Growing risk**: Harassment hints at the cost of visibility.
