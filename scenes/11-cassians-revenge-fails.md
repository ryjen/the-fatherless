## **INT. AURELIAN COUNCIL CHAMBER – NIGHT**

The chamber is closed to the public, but it is full—high seats ring the room.
Prominent rulers, generals, and priests watch from carved benches.
Torches burn low, casting long shadows across Cassian’s face.

He steps into the center, cloak heavy, eyes fixed on the council dais.

**CASSIAN:**
"The fatherless slave has returned. He undermines our order."

Murmurs ripple through the room. A few heads tilt, curious; most are weary.

## **THE PETITION**

Cassian paces, voice sharpening.

**CASSIAN:**
"Give me authority to reclaim him. Let me end this insult."

**COUNCILOR VEREK (measured):**
"You would have us chase a rumor beyond the walls?"

Cassian gestures toward the city beyond.

**CASSIAN:**
"It is not rumor. It is defiance."

An older priest raises a hand.

**HIGH PRIEST:**
"Your defiance has already shamed us."

Silence.

## **THE REFUSAL**

The presiding **ARCHON** leans forward, voice calm but final.

**ARCHON:**
"We will not grant you this pursuit."

Cassian stiffens.

**ARCHON:**
"Your obsession has become a liability."

Cassian looks around the chamber. No ally meets his gaze.

## **THE HUMILIATION**

The Archon stands, the verdict echoing off stone.

**ARCHON:**
"The matter is closed."

Cassian bows stiffly, more insult than respect.
Whispers follow him as he backs away.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Cassian exits into the corridor, the council doors shutting behind him.
The torchlight flickers against his clenched jaw.

He is surrounded by witnesses—yet utterly alone.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Power curtailed**: Cassian’s authority collapses under elite scrutiny.
* **Public-private shame**: A closed council becomes an audience of humiliation.
* **Isolation of hubris**: Ambition leaves Cassian without allies.
