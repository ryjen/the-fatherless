# **Scene 7 – Maro’s Confession**

**Location:** Cult Temple
**Time:** Night — after Sael’s departure

---

## **EXT. CULT ENTRANCE – NIGHT**

Rain begins to fall, soft and steady. Maro stands in a narrow alley, cloak soaked.
He clutches a small bundle—Cassian’s stolen ledger page—against his chest.

He knocks. Three times. Two.

The door opens a crack. A **CULT ACOLYTE** studies him.

**ACOLYTE:**
"You again?"

**MARO (voice breaking):**
"I need the elders. I must confess."

The door opens wider.

## **INT. CULT TEMPLE – NIGHT**

The chamber glows with low, amber light. Candles flicker against stone walls.
**ELDER LIRAN**, **ELDER SAHMIA**, and **ELDER BENIO** wait in a half circle.

Maro steps forward. His hands shake.

**MARO:**
"I was in the master’s house. I saw the records. I brought them to you."

He sinks to his knees.

**MARO:**
"But I did not come for purity. I came because I envied them."

Silence. The drip of water. The faint crackle of flame.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"Envy is a truth. Speak the rest."

Maro opens the bundle and lays the ledger page on the stone.

**MARO:**
"Cassian meant the child to be a spectacle. A mockery of the One."

He looks up, eyes wet.

**MARO:**
"I wanted their privilege. I wanted to be seen. I wanted to belong to power."

He presses his forehead to the cold floor.

**MARO (whispering):**
"And now I want the child to live."

## **THE STRATEGY BENEATH THE PENITENCE**

Benio studies the ledger. Liran watches Maro, unmoved.

**ELDER LIRAN:**
"Confession is not a bargain. What do you seek?"

Maro lifts his head, steadying himself.

**MARO:**
"Protection for him. For the Avarim. For Nara and Darven."

He swallows.

**MARO:**
"Cassian will hunt for what he cannot own. I can hear his voice. I know his steps."

He gestures toward the streets above.

**MARO:**
"If you are to guard Sael, you must move like shadows. You must hide in light."

Sahmia steps closer, softer now.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"You ask for mercy, but you bring us warning."

Maro nods, ashamed and resolute.

**MARO:**
"I am not worthy to stand with you. But I can walk where you cannot."

## **INT. INNER CHAMBER – LATER**

The elders stand before the mural of the child beneath the descending hand.
Maro watches from the threshold, not invited inside.

**ELDER BENIO:**
"The fatherless child is beyond our walls now."

**ELDER LIRAN:**
"Then our walls must move."

Sahmia looks back at Maro.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"Your envy brought us the truth. Your fear brings us foresight."

She turns to him.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"If you are to serve, you will serve in silence. Are you willing?"

Maro bows his head.

**MARO:**
"Yes."

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Maro stands alone in the corridor, water dripping from his cloak onto the stone.
He slips the empty bundle back under his tunic.

The candlelight behind him flickers, carving his shadow long and thin.

Outside, the rain continues—washing the city, not cleansing it.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Penitence with purpose**: Guilt becomes a tool for protection.
* **Confession as warning**: Truth is offered not for forgiveness, but for survival.
* **Shadows and service**: Maro’s role shifts from envy to unseen guardianship.
