# **Scene 4 – The Cult Discovers Sael**

**Location:** The Hidden Shrine Beneath the City
**Time:** Dawn — a few hours after Maro’s confession

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND SHRINE – PRE-DAWN**

The shrine is carved from forgotten stone beneath Rome’s lower district.
Flickering lanterns illuminate paintings of a *single god*—a symbol outlawed by Rome.
Symbols of fire, circles, and hands interlinked.

Three **Cult Elders** stand around a stone table.
They examine the ledger Maro brought, alongside clay tablets and old scrolls detailing past visions.

The room is quiet except for the soft dripping of water from the ceiling cracks.

**ELDER LIRAN (stern, analytical):**
“This is Cassian’s seal. There is no mistaking it.”

**ELDER SAHMIA (younger, fervent):**
“Two slaves—mother and son—forced to conceive. A cruelty without measure.”

She frowns, conflicted but deeply moved.

**SAHMIA:**
“But why? Why *this* pairing?”

**ELDER BENIO (oldest):**
“Because Cassian wishes to shame us.
To mock our belief in a single father who rules all life.”

He runs his fingers over the ink.

**BENIO:**
“He thinks this conception will disgust the gods.
But perhaps… he has delivered us something else.”

## **INT. SHRINE — A FEW STEPS AWAY**

A small inner chamber contains a mural:
**A child standing alone beneath a great hand descending from the heavens.**
A prophecy the cult rarely speaks aloud.

**SAHMIA (softly):**
“The prophecy says: ‘A child born without father nor master will be the mirror of the heavens.’
A symbol for all who are shackled by Rome.”

She hesitates.

**SAHMIA (whispers):**
“What if this child… is the one?”

---

## **CUT TO: EXT. SLAVE HOUSING — DAWN**

The sun rises over the Roman rooftops.
Birds scatter as the morning horn sounds in the distance.

Two cult acolytes—**JOREN** and **LYSSA**—arrive dressed as merchants.
Their clothing conceals symbols of the cult sewn inside the sleeves.

They whisper as they approach Nara and Darven’s sleeping area.

---

## **INT. SLAVE HOUSING – DAWN**

The room is quiet.
Some slaves still sleep; others are preparing for the day.

At the far corner:

* **Nara** rests from the pains of conception.
* **Darven** sleeps on the ground, curled around himself.

Joren and Lyssa approach carefully.

Nara wakes groggily, confused.

**NARA:**
“Who are you?”

**JOREN (kind, gentle):**
“We bring no harm.
We bring truth.”

Darven wakes, defensive.

**DARVEN:**
“If you’re from the master—”

**LYSSA:**
“We are not.
We’re from those who remember one god.
And we come to warn you.”

Nara and Darven exchange a frightened look.

---

## **JOREN REVEALS THE CRUELTY**

Joren kneels in front of them, pulling out the ledger page with Cassian’s symbol.

**JOREN:**
“This record—Cassian wrote it.
He knew you were mother and son.”

Nara’s breath catches.
Darven’s face goes pale.

**DARVEN (broken whisper):**
“No… no… that can’t be…”

**NARA (tears forming):**
“But he said it was a… privilege…”

**LYSSA (softly):**
“It was not a privilege.
It was a spectacle.
A joke for the elite.”

The words strike them like a blow.

Nara covers her face.
Darven trembles with shame and nausea.

**DARVEN:**
“We didn’t know. We… we didn’t know…”

**JOREN:**
“No one blames you.
You were deceived.”

He reaches out, not touching, but close enough to show compassion.

---

## **THE CATALYST MOMENT**

**LYSSA:**
“There will be a child.
We believe this child may be… important.”

Nara drops her hands, stunned.

**NARA:**
“Important? How can something born of such cruelty be anything but cursed?”

**JOREN:**
“Because you are innocent.
And because your suffering reveals Rome’s corruption.”

The cultists exchange a look.

**LYSSA:**
“And because sometimes, the gods answer cruelty with purity.
Light born from the darkest of intentions.”

Darven wipes his eyes.

**DARVEN:**
“What do you want from us?”

**JOREN:**
“To protect the child.
And—if you will allow it—
to raise him among us.”

Nara gasps as though struck.
Darven tightens his jaw.

**NARA:**
“You want to take my baby?”

**LYSSA:**
“Not as a possession.
As a symbol.
As hope.
As what Rome fears most—
a life they cannot own.”

---

## **INT. SHRINE — MOMENTS LATER (INTERCUT)**

The Elders stand before the mural again.

**BENIO:**
“Cassian’s arrogance has handed us a child with no true father.
Only a master’s cruelty.”

He taps the mural.

**BENIO:**
“And the prophecy says the fatherless child will lead us toward a new dawn.”

---

## **BACK TO SLAVE QUARTERS**

Nara looks at Darven.
Tears. Fear. Love. Shame.

They both know their world is not safe for a newborn.

**NARA (broken):**
“If he stays here… Cassian will take him. Twist him. Destroy him.”

Darven nods.

“Let him be raised by people who see him as more than a slave.”

She turns to Joren.

**NARA:**
“You may take him.
But promise me—
promise me he will not grow up in shame.”

**JOREN:**
“We promise.”

Lyssa places her hand over her heart.

**LYSSA:**
“He will grow up knowing he is fatherless only in the eyes of Rome—
never in the eyes of the divine.”

---

## **FINAL IMAGE OF THE SCENE**

The cultists clasp Nara and Darven’s hands.
A moment of shared grief.
Shared hope.
Shared destiny.

The sun streams into the chamber.
Light falls across Nara’s abdomen—
the place where Sael’s story begins.

Fade out.
