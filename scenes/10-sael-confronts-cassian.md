# **Scene 10 – Sael Confronts Cassian**

**Location:** Avarim outskirts / Cult safe house
**Time:** Late afternoon

---

## **EXT. AVARIM OUTSKIRTS – LATE AFTERNOON**

The land opens into scrub and low stone walls. Aurelia’s towers sit distant behind dust.
Sael stands at the edge of the path, calm and still.

**MARO** lingers a few steps behind, half-shadowed. **ELDER SAHMIA** watches from a doorway.

Hoofbeats. Cassian arrives with two guards, cloaks stiff with city pride.

**CASSIAN:**
"There you are."

Sael does not move.

## **THE CLAIM**

Cassian steps closer, eyes hard.

**CASSIAN:**
"You were born under my roof. That makes you mine."

Sael’s voice is even, gentle.

**SAEL:**
"I am fatherless."

Cassian’s mouth twists into a smile that does not reach his eyes.

**CASSIAN:**
"Then you are nothing. You belong to Aurelia, to its rules, to me."

Behind Sael, Maro flinches. Sahmia’s hands tighten on the doorframe.

---

## **THE FORGIVENESS**

Sael steps forward, closing the distance by a pace.
He looks at Cassian as if seeing the wound beneath the armor.

**SAEL:**
"You gave me a name of shame. I will not return it."

Cassian laughs once, sharp.

**CASSIAN:**
"You think you can forgive me?"

Sael nods, simply.

**SAEL:**
"I forgive you."

The words land like a blow. Cassian’s jaw tightens.

---

## **THE WITNESSES**

Maro’s eyes glisten; he lowers his head.
Sahmia exhales slowly, as if a prophecy has just taken shape.

The guards shift uneasily, unsure of what they are hearing.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Cassian turns away, furious, his cloak snapping in the wind.
Sael remains in the light, unmoved.

The boundary between Avarim earth and Aurelian road sits like a line drawn in dust.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Moral authority vs. ownership**: Sael rejects Cassian’s claim without violence.
* **Forgiveness as defiance**: Mercy becomes an act of power.
* **Witnessed turning point**: Maro and the cult see Sael step into his public role.
