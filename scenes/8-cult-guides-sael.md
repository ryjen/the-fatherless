## **MONTAGE – SAEL’S MORAL FORMATION**

**EXT. AVARIM OUTSKIRTS – EARLY MORNING**

Wide shot: a small community waking with the sun. Sael, now a child, carries water with other youths.
He pauses to lift a fallen sparrow, cradling it, whispering a prayer before setting it free.

**INT. CULT LEARNING HALL – DAY**

Sael, older, sits among students. **ELDER SAHMIA** rolls out a scroll.

**SAHMIA:**
"The Stoics teach: what is within your control is your soul."

Sael listens, eyes steady, then offers his bread to a thinner boy beside him.

**EXT. GARDEN COURTYARD – AFTERNOON**

An **AVARIM ELDER** traces letters in sand.

**ELDER RIMA:**
"Remember the One, and remember the stranger."

Sael repeats the words under his breath. He helps a traveler wash his feet at the well.

**INT. SMALL SHRINE – NIGHT**

Candles flicker. A visiting **EASTERN TEACHER** speaks softly.

**EASTERN TEACHER:**
"Compassion is not weakness. It is the mirror of the divine."

Sael sits with eyes closed, breathing, the candlelight reflecting in his face.

**EXT. MARKET ROAD – DAY**

Teenage Sael walks between elders. A hostile trader spits at his feet.

Sael looks down, then up—calm.

**SAEL:**
"May your anger find rest."

The trader hesitates, unsettled.

**INT. CULT HALL – DUSK**

Sael reads from a worn tablet. Children gather around him.

**SAEL:**
"Forgiveness is not the forgetting of pain—"

He pauses, searching for the right words.

**SAEL:**
"—it is the refusal to pass it on."

The children nod. A faint smile touches Sahmia’s face from the doorway.

## **FINAL IMAGE OF THE MONTAGE**

Sael stands on a hillside at sunrise, now a young man.
The city of Aurelia is distant, small, almost unreal.

He faces the light, hands open, wind moving his robe.

Fade out.
