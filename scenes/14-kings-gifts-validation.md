# **Scene 14 – Kings’ Gifts and Validation**

**Location:** Sael’s camp / Avarim outskirts
**Time:** Late afternoon

---

## **EXT. SAEL’S CAMP – LATE AFTERNOON**

The air is still. The kings’ retinues wait at the edge of the camp, horses held.
A small cloth is spread before Sael—no throne, no dais, only earth.

The **KING OF MARA** signals his attendants.
A chest is opened: fragrant resin, rare oil, finely worked metal.

**KING OF MARA:**
"We bring gifts, not tribute."

Sael inclines his head, accepting without pride.

## **THE VALIDATION**

The **KING OF TIR** steps forward, voice calm but clear.

**KING OF TIR:**
"We sought peace in Aurelia and found only noise."

He gestures to Sael.

**KING OF TIR:**
"In you we found quiet. In quiet, we found truth."

Maro watches, measuring every word. Sahmia’s gaze hardens—this is weight, not praise.

## **THE WARNING**

The third king, older and stern, lowers his voice.

**KING OF VASH:**
"We will speak with your rulers in the city. They will ask why we came here first."

Sael answers without hesitation.

**SAEL:**
"Tell them you came to see a man without a master."

The king studies him, then nods once.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

The gifts sit in the dust—simple, unclaimed, heavy with meaning.
Sael looks toward the distant city, the line of walls visible in the haze.

Behind him, the kings prepare to ride on.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Recognition without spectacle**: The gifts honor moral authority, not power.
* **Quiet legitimacy**: Peace validates Sael’s presence more than politics can.
* **Approaching consequence**: The city will not ignore this visit.
