## **INT. AURELIAN SENATE – DAY**

The senate chamber hums with low argument. Marble benches, cold light.
Senators speak over one another—irritated that a slave has drawn the notice of three kings.

**SENATOR KORVUS (heated):**
"A nameless slave draws foreign kings. We should not be discussing him at all."

**SENATOR LYS (sharp):**
"And yet we are."

The room stills, not from agreement but from strategy.

## **THE PRAGMATIC TURN**

The **ARCHON** raises a hand. The argument collapses into silence.

**ARCHON:**
"Their presence has already elevated him. We end that contagion."

He gestures to Cassian, who stands near the wall, unreadable.

**ARCHON:**
"Crucify him as a king. Let the kings see the cost of pretending."

Murmurs rise—uneasy, resentful, but calculating.

## **THE DECISION**

An older senator speaks, colder than the rest.

**SENATOR VEREK:**
"Make the punishment a theater. We are tired of executing men without effect."

Cassian’s eyes lift, a flicker of approval.

**CASSIAN (quiet):**
"It will be done."

## **FINAL IMAGE**

The vote passes with raised hands, more reluctant than righteous.
Outside, sunlight spills onto the steps, indifferent.

Inside, the plan becomes policy.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Insignificance turned threat**: A small figure forces a state response.
* **Cold strategy over heat**: Emotion gives way to calculated spectacle.
* **Power as theater**: Authority preserves itself through display.
