# **Scene 18 – Cult’s Counter**

**Location:** Underground temple / city corners
**Time:** Night

---

## **INT. UNDERGROUND TEMPLE – NIGHT**

Candles line the walls, their light barely touching the ceiling.
Dozens gather in a tight circle, faces half-lit, breaths held.

**ELDER SAHMIA** stands at the center, voice low but steady.

**SAHMIA:**
"They displayed a man to mock a name. We will speak the name with mercy."

She lifts a small clay lamp.

**SAHMIA:**
"Sael is born of one God. A God who loves the broken and the ashamed."

The circle bows, a shared silence like prayer.

## **CUT TO: DISPERSED GATHERINGS**

**EXT. BACK ALLEY – NIGHT**
Two disciples whisper to a small cluster, passing a candle from hand to hand.

**DISCIPLE:**
"Forgiveness is strength. It is how the weak become unowned."

**INT. WORKSHOP – NIGHT**
A potter pauses his wheel as a woman repeats Sael’s words to her children.

**WOMAN:**
"Let it end with us."

**EXT. ROOFTOP – NIGHT**
Maro listens as a young man recites Sael’s teaching to a friend, eyes shining.

## **THE RESOLVE**

Back in the temple, Sahmia presses her palm to the mural of the descending hand.

**SAHMIA (whisper):**
"They tried to bury the light in spectacle. We will carry it quietly."

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Candles flicker in doorways across the city, one by one.
A map of small flames spreads through the dark.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Quiet resistance**: Truth spreads through whispers, not crowds.
* **Moral contagion**: Sael’s message travels like fire in the dark.
* **Community of the unseen**: The cult counters spectacle with humility.
