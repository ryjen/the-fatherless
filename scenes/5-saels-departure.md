# **Scene 5 – Sael’s Departure**

**Location:** The Avarim Outskirts
**Time:** Dawn — weeks after Scene 4

---

## **INT. SLAVE HOUSING – PRE-DAWN**

The room is dim, the air heavy with ash and early chill.
A small oil lamp flickers beside **NARA**, cradling a newborn swaddled tight.
**DARVEN** sits close, his hands hovering—afraid to touch, afraid to let go.

Outside, a single bird cries. The city is still asleep.

**NARA (whispering to the child):**
"Sael... my light."

Footsteps approach. **JOREN** and **LYSSA** enter quietly, cloaks pulled low.

**JOREN (soft, urgent):**
"It is time. The road is clear."

Darven’s jaw tightens. He looks to Nara, searching for strength.

**DARVEN:**
"Will he be safe?"

**LYSSA:**
"As safe as any child can be in a world that fears him."

Nara presses her forehead to the infant’s.

**NARA:**
"Promise me he will know love."

**JOREN:**
"He will grow among those who refuse to kneel to cruelty."

## **EXT. BACK ALLEY / CITY EDGE – DAWN**

The group moves through narrow alleys, the infant bundled beneath Lyssa’s cloak.
Nara and Darven follow at a distance, faces hidden, shadows long.

The city walls rise behind them, cold and indifferent.
Ahead, the land opens—dry grass, scattered stones, the first line of sunrise.

## **EXT. AVARIM OUTSKIRTS – DAWN**

A small gathering waits: **AVARIM ELDERS**, robed in earth tones, standing beside a simple hearth.
Their eyes are watchful, not fearful.

**ELDER TAREK (measured, calm):**
"We honor the covenant. The child will be raised in truth."

Lyssa steps forward, unveiling Sael.
The elders look down at him with reverent stillness.

**ELDER RIMA (gentle):**
"No master will name him here. Only the One."

Nara hesitates, then steps into the open.
She holds Sael one last time, her hands trembling.

**NARA:**
"Forgive us, little one. Forgive the world we are leaving you to."

She kisses his brow and turns him toward the rising sun.

Darven places a small woven cord in the blanket—a token of his own making.

**DARVEN (low):**
"So you remember... you were loved."

Joren receives the child, bowing his head.

**JOREN:**
"We will guard him. The dawn will know his name."

## **THE DEPARTURE**

The Avarim carry Sael toward the hills.
Nara and Darven remain at the edge of the path, silhouettes against the light.

The sun crests the horizon, washing the ground in gold.
Sael’s tiny hand slips free of the blanket, reaching toward the light.

Fade out.
