# **Scene 16 – Maro’s Guilt and Coercion**

**Location:** Dungeon / torture chamber
**Time:** Night

---

## **INT. DUNGEON – NIGHT**

The air is wet and metallic. Chains hang from beams. A brazier hisses with heat.
Maro is bound to a post, shirt torn, wrists raw.

Cassian circles him, calm. Two guards wait with instruments—iron hooks, a leather strap, a bucket of water.

**CASSIAN:**
"You always knew more than you said."

Maro lifts his chin, breathing hard.

**MARO:**
"I know enough to be ashamed."

Cassian nods to a guard.

## **THE TORTURE**

The guard lashes Maro across the back. Skin splits. Blood darkens in the torchlight.
Maro gasps, then bites the sound back.

Cassian steps closer, voice low.

**CASSIAN:**
"Where is he?"

Maro spits blood.

**MARO:**
"Not yours."

Another lash. Then another. The strap snaps against bone and flesh.
Maro’s knees buckle against the rope.

Cassian takes a heated iron from the brazier, holds it near Maro’s cheek.
The heat shimmers in the air.

**CASSIAN:**
"Names."

Maro closes his eyes. A beat.

**MARO (broken):**
"The Avarim. The cult. He walks with them."

The iron withdraws. Cassian sets it aside, satisfied.

## **THE COERCION**

Cassian wipes his hands with a cloth, calm again.

**CASSIAN:**
"You will carry my message."

Maro’s head lifts, dazed.

**CASSIAN:**
"Tell him the kings will enter the city. Tell him to come."

Maro laughs once, bitter.

**MARO:**
"Why would he listen to me now?"

Cassian leans in, whispering.

**CASSIAN:**
"Because if he does not, Nara will not live to see dawn."

Maro freezes.

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Maro hangs, shaking, blood dripping to the stone.
Cassian exits, his shadow dragging across the floor.

The brazier’s glow fades as the door closes.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Violence as leverage**: Torture turns truth into a tool of coercion.
* **Guilt weaponized**: Maro’s compassion becomes his chain.
* **Inevitable trap**: Cassian forces the path toward Sael’s capture.
