# **Scene 22 – Post-Death Legacy**

**Location:** Aurelian streets / Avarim camp
**Time:** Days later

---

## **EXT. CITY STREETS – DAY**

Children run between stalls, sing-song and bright.

**CHILDREN (singing):**
"Fatherless, fearless, Sael of the dawn..."

Adults glance around, some smiling despite themselves, others fearful.

---

## **INT. HIDDEN ROOM – DAY**

In a small room, a few disciples sit close. A single candle burns.
**ELDER SAHMIA** repeats Sael’s final teaching, the words passed like bread.

**SAHMIA:**
"Mercy must be seen."

The group nods, committing it to memory.

---

## **EXT. PALACE BALCONY – DAY**

Cassian hears the song carried on the wind.
His face tightens. He turns away, fists clenched.

---

## **EXT. AVARIM CAMP – DUSK**

Maro kneels by a small fire, speaking to a handful of youths.

**MARO:**
"He left no throne, only a way."

The children listen, eyes wide, the fire reflected in them.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

The children’s song drifts over the city while the cult’s whispers move beneath it.
Two currents, one truth.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Legacy in song and whisper**: Sael’s memory lives in both public and hidden spaces.
* **Powerless rage**: Cassian cannot silence the story.
* **Moral continuity**: The cult becomes a living echo of Sael’s mercy.
