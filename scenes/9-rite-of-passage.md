# **Scene 9 – Rite of Passage**

**Location:** Cult Temple / Inner Chamber
**Time:** Night — still and windless

---

## **INT. CULT TEMPLE – NIGHT**

The chamber is quiet, lit by a ring of candles.
No chanting. Only breath and the soft crackle of wax.

Sael, now a young man, stands at the center. The elders form a small circle.
**ELDER BENIO** carries a covered tablet.

**BENIO:**
"You have been taught many paths."

He gestures to Sahmia and Liran, then to the simple mural of the descending hand.

**BENIO:**
"Tonight, you are shown the path beneath them all."

Benio uncovers the tablet. It bears Cassian’s seal.

Sael’s eyes linger on it, confused.

## **THE REVELATION**

**ELDER LIRAN:**
"Your birth was arranged by cruelty."

Sael’s brow tightens.

**ELDER SAHMIA (soft):**
"Your mother and father were bound in ignorance. Rome named you a mistake."

She steps closer, her voice barely above a whisper.

**SAHMIA:**
"But you are fatherless only in the eyes of Rome."

Sael’s hands tremble. He looks down at the seal, then at the mural.

**SAEL:**
"So I am a wound."

**BENIO:**
"You are a mirror."

The words hang in the air.

## **SAEL’S GRIEF**

Sael turns away, swallowing hard.
He walks to the edge of the candlelight, shadowing his face.

**SAEL (quiet):**
"I was born from shame."

Sahmia approaches but does not touch him.

**SAHMIA:**
"Shame was their weapon. Compassion is yours."

Sael closes his eyes. His breath steadies.

---

## **THE ACCEPTANCE**

He returns to the circle, voice low but clear.

**SAEL:**
"If the world sees me as fatherless, then let it also see mercy."

Benio lifts his palm in a blessing.

**BENIO:**
"Then you accept what may come."

Sael nods once.

**SAEL:**
"I accept."

The elders bow their heads. The candles flicker in unison.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Sael stands alone before the mural.
The candlelight makes the painted hand appear to move toward him.

He does not flinch.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**
