# **Scene 13 – Three Kings Arrive**

**Location:** Avarim outskirts / Sael’s camp
**Time:** Day

---

## **EXT. AVARIM OUTSKIRTS – DAY**

The road is quiet. A small sentry line stands at the edge of the Avarim camp.
Dust rises in the distance—three caravans, each marked by a different banner.

Sael waits with a handful of elders and **MARO**, the wind tugging at their cloaks.

The first king dismounts, guarded but calm. Two others follow, their entourages kept back.

**KING OF MARA (measured):**
"We asked to see the child, not the city."

Sahmia nods, wary.

**ELDER SAHMIA:**
"Then you have come to the right place."

## **THE MEETING**

Sael steps forward, unarmed.

**KING OF TIR (soft, curious):**
"You are the one they call fatherless?"

Sael holds his gaze.

**SAEL:**
"If that name brings peace, I accept it."

The kings exchange a glance—quiet, calculating.

## **CONTROLLED ACCESS**

Avarim sentries keep the road closed. The kings’ retinues wait at a distance.
No crowd gathers. Only a small ring of witnesses, chosen and restrained.

Maro watches every movement, aware of the political weight in the dust.

## **FINAL IMAGE**

The kings bow their heads—not in worship, but in respect.
Sael stands between them and the city, a fragile line of peace.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Tense diplomacy**: Power meets moral authority on neutral ground.
* **Controlled visibility**: Sael’s significance is kept guarded and deliberate.
* **Recognition without spectacle**: Respect is earned in quiet.
