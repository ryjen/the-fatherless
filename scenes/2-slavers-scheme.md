### **Scene 2 – The Slaver’s Scheme**

**Location:** Slave quarters, dimly lit, remnants of the previous night’s orgy in the palace visible from afar.

**Action / Story Beats:**

* Cassian **stumbles back drunk** from the palace, his toga disheveled, still hearing echoes of laughter and music from the elite halls.
* He reflects bitterly on his **reputation among peers**: criticized for being “too strict” as a slave master, too intolerant for his own taste.
* **Inner monologue / voiceover (optional):** “They mock me for enforcing discipline… yet I see the weakness of this city. I will remind them why Rome is feared.”
* In the slave quarters, he **unrolls ledgers and family records**, methodically scanning names and relations, revealing a mother and son unaware of their connection.
* Cassian **schemes with deliberate cruelty**: he arranges them to “earn a reward” for their loyalty and hard work.
* **Dialogue Cue (Cassian, sinisterly cordial):**
  “You have served well. Rome wishes to honor your diligence… a reward worthy of distinction.”
* Cassian manipulates the situation, **allowing and arranging their conception**, presenting it as a **privilege akin to what the elite receive**.
* **Camera / Visuals:**

  * Close-up on Cassian’s fingers tracing the family records.
  * Medium shot of him standing over the mother and son, shadows across their faces, unaware.
  * Low-angle on Cassian, emphasizing dominance and moral corruption.
  * Candlelight flickers, creating stark contrasts: **his dark intent vs. their innocence**.
* **Symbolism:**

  * Shows **manipulation of fate**, cruelty disguised as privilege.
  * Establishes Sael’s **fatherless, morally ironic birth** as a direct product of elite corruption.
* **Tone / Feel:** Gritty, morally unsettling; quiet but tense atmosphere contrasting with palace decadence.
