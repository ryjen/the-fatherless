# **Scene 17 – Public Punishment**

**Location:** Aurelian city square
**Time:** Day

## **EXT. CITY SQUARE – DAY**

The square is packed. Soldiers form a ring. Vendors and citizens press against the cordon.
At the center, a wooden frame stands like a cruel stage.

Sael is bound upright, arms stretched, a rough crown of thorns pressed onto his brow.
Blood runs in thin lines down his temples.

---

## **THE TABLET**

An iron tablet hangs from the frame, swinging slightly.
The crowd leans in to read it. Whispers ripple outward.

Close-up on the etched words:
**“Sael, born of incest, cult-raised, false king of the Avarim.”**

The whispers grow into a low, restless hum.

## **THE CROWD**

A woman covers her child’s eyes. A man spits in the dirt. Another falls silent, shaken.

Cassian watches from a shaded platform, face unreadable.
Maro stands at the edge of the crowd, hood pulled low, eyes wet.

---

## **SAEL’S SILENCE**

Sael lifts his head as far as the thorns allow.
He says nothing. His calm unsettles the square.

The wind shifts. The crown catches the light.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

The tablet swings, casting a shadow across Sael’s face.
Half the crowd bows, half the crowd seethes.

The city is split in the space of a breath.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Public spectacle of cruelty**: Truth used as a weapon.
