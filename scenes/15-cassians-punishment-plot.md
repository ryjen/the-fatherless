# **Scene 15 – Cassian’s Punishment and Plot**

**Location:** Palace / Council antechamber
**Time:** Night

## **INT. COUNCIL ANTECHAMBER – NIGHT**

The council has ended. The corridor is empty, polished stone echoing with distant voices.
Cassian waits, rigid, hands clasped behind his back.

The **ARCHON** steps out with two attendants, closing the doors behind him.

**ARCHON:**
"You will mend what you have frayed."

Cassian bows slightly, jaw tight.

**CASSIAN:**
"And if I do?"

The Archon’s expression does not change.

**ARCHON:**
"Then you remain useful."

He takes a half step closer, voice lowered.

**ARCHON:**
"If you fail, you become the example."

Cassian’s eyes flicker—anger, then calculation.

## **THE ASSIGNMENT**

The Archon gestures toward the corridor leading to the outer halls.

**ARCHON:**
"The kings will enter the city tomorrow. You will stand beside us and make this insult disappear."

Cassian nods once, controlled.

**CASSIAN:**
"I will resolve it."

The Archon turns away without farewell.

## **INT. CASSIAN’S QUARTERS – LATER**

Cassian pours wine, hands steady. The room is silent except for the pour.

He stares at a map of Aurelia and its outskirts, then at a small carving of a crown.

**CASSIAN (to himself):**
"They want a remedy. I will give them a spectacle."

He sets the crown beside the map—an idea taking shape.

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Cassian’s face is lit by a single lamp, half in shadow.
Outside, the city hums with the approach of the kings.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Cold leverage**: The council uses Cassian as a tool, not a partner.
* **Threat behind duty**: Obedience is demanded under silent threat.
* **Cruelty as solution**: Cassian turns humiliation into a plan for violence.
