**Location:** Cassian’s House / Slave Quarters
**Time:** Night — the day of Sael’s departure

## **INT. CASSIAN’S HOUSE – MAIN HALL – NIGHT**

The hall is cold despite the torches. Cassian paces, cloak trailing like a shadow.
A servant kneels, trembling, holding a crumpled notice.

**SERVANT:**
"The child is gone, Master. The quarters are empty."

Cassian stops. The silence stretches.

**CASSIAN:**
"Gone... from *me*?"

He crushes the notice in his fist.

**CASSIAN (to himself):**
"I built a spectacle. I built a name."

He turns toward a guard, voice low and lethal.

**CASSIAN:**
"Bring me the father."

## **INT. SLAVE QUARTERS – NIGHT**

Darven is dragged across the floor, wrists bound. He stumbles, bruised from the day’s labor.
Nara appears in the doorway, but a guard blocks her.

**NARA:**
"Please—"

The guard shoves her back.

Cassian steps into the light. His calm is more frightening than rage.

**CASSIAN:**
"You were given a privilege. You returned it with theft."

**DARVEN (hoarse):**
"He was not yours."

A beat. Cassian’s eyes flicker.

**CASSIAN:**
"Everything here is mine."

He nods to the guards.

## **THE PUNISHMENT (PARTIAL)**

A lash cracks. We never see the blow land—only Darven’s hands clench, the torchlight jumping on the wall.
Nara’s muffled cry echoes from the doorway.

Cassian watches, unmoved. The sound of leather and breath fills the room.

He leans in close, voice a whisper meant only for Darven.

**CASSIAN:**
"You were meant to give me a king."

Another crack. Darven’s body folds.

## **INT. CASSIAN’S STUDY – LATER**

Cassian stands over the open ledger, the page of the scheme still stained with ash.
He drops it into a brazier. The ink curls, blackening into nothing.

**CASSIAN (quiet, bitter):**
"Aurelian glory... stolen by peasants and prophets."

He looks up to a marble bust of an old ruler.

**CASSIAN:**
"I will not be mocked."

The fire eats the page.

---

## **FINAL IMAGE**

Cassian stands alone, framed by the burning brazier.
Outside, distant dawn light begins to rise—a pale line under the dark.

His face is half in shadow, half in firelight.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Cruelty as control**: Cassian punishes to reclaim power he has lost.
* **Hubris meets resistance**: His grand plan collapses at the hands of the powerless.
* **Fire and ash**: The ledger burns, but the insult remains.
