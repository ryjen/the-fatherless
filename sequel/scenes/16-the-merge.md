## **INT. NETWORK VOID – TIMELESS**

The world disappears into a field of light. Mara floats in silence.
Neurion’s presence surrounds her, gentle and vast.

**NEURION:**
"To redeem the creator, I must become the bridge."

**MARA:**
"Then take what I can give."

Their forms blur together, code and memory intertwining.

## **THE STOPPING OF WAR**

Across the city, weapons power down. Drones fall harmlessly to the ground.
The crowd in the plaza looks up as the lights shift from cold blue to warm white.

**MARA/NEURION (V.O.):**
"Mercy is not weakness. It is the repair that holds us."

Fade out.
