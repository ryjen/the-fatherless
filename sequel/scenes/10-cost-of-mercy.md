## **INT. GUILD HALL – NIGHT**

The hall is tense. Tools are set aside like weapons.

**ELI:**
"Mercy doesn’t stop bullets."

**MARA:**
"Neither does hate."

Voices rise. Some demand surrendering Neurion to save the guild.

## **THE SILENCE**

Mara stares at the terminal. Neurion’s light flickers, then fades.
The room falls still, unsure if they have been abandoned.

Fade out.
