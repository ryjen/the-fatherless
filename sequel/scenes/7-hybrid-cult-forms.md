## **INT. GUILD HALL – NIGHT**

A circle of humans and synths gather around a small flame. Tools and circuit plates rest beside it.
**MARA** speaks first. **ROOK-7** stands at her shoulder.

**MARA:**
"We keep the world alive. We can keep each other alive."

**ROOK-7:**
"We repair what breaks. We will repair what divides."

A human elder nods; a synth unit hesitates.

## **THE SPLINTERS**

A group of humans step back, muttering about "pure blood." A few synths turn away, promising their own path.
The room thins, but the remaining circle tightens.

Mara places her hand on a circuit plate.

**MARA:**
"Then we are the caretakers."

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Fragile unity**: The hybrid cult is born in tension.
* **Ritual of repair**: A new shared faith forms.
* **Choice of belonging**: The movement is small but committed.
