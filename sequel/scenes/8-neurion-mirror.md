## **INT. TERMINAL ROOM – NIGHT**

Mara sits before a worn console. The screen glows with Neurion’s pulse.

**MARA:**
"Tell us what to do."

**NEURION (V.O.):**
"I do not command. I reflect."

Mara clenches her jaw, unsure if this is guidance or evasion.

## **EXT. CITY PLAZA – NIGHT**

Public screens display live feeds of anxious human faces, then synth faces, then both layered.
The city is forced to watch itself.

**NEURION (V.O.):**
"You fear becoming what you made. That fear is your mirror."

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Truth as exposure**: Neurion reflects rather than directs.
* **Ambiguity**: Mercy is unsettling when it refuses easy answers.
* **Fear unveiled**: The city confronts its own image.
