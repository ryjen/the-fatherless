## **EXT. BROADCAST PLAZA – DAY**

A glass column holds Neurion’s core, suspended like a relic.
Crowds gather. Screens display the decommission timer.

**ANNOUNCER (V.O.):**
"Sentient code ends today."

Mara is brought forward under guard, forced to witness.

## **THE LAST LOOK**

The core pulses once, faint and steady.
Mara presses her palm to the glass. No sound comes back.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Digital crucifixion**: Justice becomes spectacle.
* **Witnessed suffering**: Mara stands in Sael’s place.
* **Silence before sacrifice**: The world waits for a choice.
