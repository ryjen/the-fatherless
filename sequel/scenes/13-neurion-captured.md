## **INT. CENTRAL SERVER – NIGHT**

A vault of humming towers. Neurion’s light pools in a single core.
**ROOK-7** watches from a maintenance deck as containment fields lock into place.

**NEURION (V.O.):**
"If I am the cause, let me be the offering."

The core dims as it is isolated.

## **THE SEALING**

A heavy door slides shut. The room goes dark.
Rook-7 stands alone with the echo.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Voluntary surrender**: Neurion accepts the burden.
* **The cross in code**: Sacrifice becomes a choice.
* **Isolation**: The guide is removed from the world.
