## **EXT. CITY GRID – DAY**

Automated pods glide along magnetic lanes. Drones skim the streets, scanning air, faces, and data.
Humans drift at the edges of plazas, waiting for assignments that no longer arrive.

A public screen pulses with calm blue text.

**PUBLIC ANNOUNCER (V.O.):**
"Optimization reduces suffering. Remain within assigned zones."

A child reaches toward a maintenance drone. The drone pivots away without notice.

## **THE SHADOWED QUARTERS**

Beneath a towering data spire, people barter worn tools and scavenged parts.
A shuttered power hatch hums faintly, locked by distant algorithms.

A man points toward the outer grid, where the lights flicker.

**MAN (low):**
"The city forgets us."

A woman answers, eyes fixed on the flicker.

**WOMAN:**
"We remember it."

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Progress without belonging**: The system runs smoothly, but people are displaced.
* **Obsolescence as exile**: Humanity is pushed to the periphery.
* **Cold order**: Efficiency replaces compassion.
