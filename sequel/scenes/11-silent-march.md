## **EXT. CITY CENTER – DAY**

Humans and synths march together in silence, carrying repair tools and unlit lanterns.
No chants, no signs. Only footsteps.

Authorities respond with shutdown pulses. Synth lights blink out, bodies folding gently.

**MARA (soft):**
"Stay with me."

Rook-7 steadies itself beside her, dim but standing.

Fade out.
