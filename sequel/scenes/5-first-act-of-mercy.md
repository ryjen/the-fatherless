## **EXT. OUTER GRID – DUSK**

A human mob surrounds a synth outpost, hurling metal rods and EMP charges.
**MARA** pushes through the crowd, hands raised.

**MARA:**
"We repair what the city abandons. We do not break what holds it together."

The mob hesitates. A charge sparks to life.

---

## **THE INTERVENTION**

Lights across the street blink. The charge powers down in a soft flicker.
A calm voice fills the air.

**NEURION (V.O.):**
"Mercy is the first repair."

The mob lowers their weapons. A synth steps forward, palms open.

## **AFTERMATH**

Rook-7 appears at the edge of the outpost, watching Mara.
Their eyes meet in the fading light.

Fade out.
