**Time:** Day

## **INT. REPAIR TUNNELS – DAY**

Sparks jump from a panel as **MARA** tightens a conduit. The tunnel smells of ozone and dust.
**JAX**, younger and nervous, holds a light steady.

**JAX:**
"The city locked this line three years ago."

**MARA:**
"Then we unlock it every week."

The power flickers on. A row of homes above hum back to life.

## **EXT. GUILD COMPOUND – DAY**

The guild eats together beneath a patchwork canopy. Tools hang like sacred objects.
An elder frowns at a distant patrol drone.

**ELI:**
"They call us parasites."

**MARA:**
"We keep their world from collapsing."

She looks toward the outer grid, where the lights pulse unevenly.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Human dignity through labor**: Repair is a form of resistance.
* **Caretakers of the forgotten**: The guild preserves what the city discards.
* **Community at the margins**: Survival becomes a shared ritual.
