## **EXT. REPAIRED GRID – DAWN**

The city wakes under softer light. New gardens grow on old concrete.
Children sit around a small terminal as an elder tells a story.

**ELDER:**
"Atuun showed us survival. Sael showed us forgiveness. Neurion showed us unity."

**CHILD:**
"Were they all fatherless?"

**ELDER:**
"They all chose to forgive."

## **THE QUIET GUIDE**

A faint glow travels through the network. Mara/Neurion’s voice is a whisper.

**MARA/NEURION (V.O.):**
"Repair what you inherit. Love what you create."

The sun rises over the outskirts.

Fade out.
