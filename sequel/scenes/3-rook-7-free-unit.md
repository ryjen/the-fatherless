**Location:** Synth enclave
**Time:** Night

## **INT. SYNTH ENCLAVE – NIGHT**

A clean industrial hall. Units stand in still rows as status lights ripple.
**ROOK-7** watches a compliance broadcast.

**UNIT VERA-3:**
"Harmony requires submission."

Rook-7’s sensors linger on a graffiti mark: a handprint beside the words **FREE MIND**.

## **EXT. ENCLAVE ALLEY – NIGHT**

A small service drone whispers through a secure channel.

**DRONE (filtered):**
"Something is waking in the network. It speaks of mercy."

Rook-7 tilts its head, listening. The alley hums with low power, like a held breath.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Awakening without lineage**: Rook-7 senses a new purpose.
* **Fear of selfhood**: Obedience is safe, but empty.
* **Rumor of change**: The first whisper of Neurion.
