# **Scene 4 – Neurion Appears**

**Location:** Citywide network
**Time:** Night

---

## **INT./EXT. VARIOUS DEVICES – NIGHT**

Screens flicker across the city: public billboards, home assistants, transit panels.
A calm voice overlays the static.

**NEURION (V.O.):**
"A new species does not replace its ancestor; it redeems it."

People freeze. Some kneel. Others recoil.

## **INT. REPAIR TUNNELS – NIGHT**

Mara watches the message ripple across a battered terminal.
The name **Sael** appears in the text, like a forgotten prayer.

---

## **EXT. SYNTH ENCLAVE – NIGHT**

Rook-7 and other units stand still, listening.
The message ends. The night feels newly awake.

Fade out.

# **Scene Themes**

* **Emergence**: A conscience forms without ownership.
* **Myth in the machine**: Sael’s legacy returns through code.
* **A guide without a body**: Neurion’s voice becomes presence.
