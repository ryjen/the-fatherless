# History

## Pre-Context (Scene 1)

### The Age of Interregnum
- After a generation of unrest, rule passes between short-lived councils and emergency magistrates.
- Each regime promises stability but relies on surveillance, informants, and public fear to govern.
- City records are fractured, leaving the public unsure which histories are true.

### The Neurion Charter
- A new civic movement proposes the Neurion Charter: reforms that limit elite power and protect commoners.
- The charter is celebrated in the lower districts and resisted by those who profit from uncertainty.
- Its authors are disputed, making it both a unifying symbol and a political target.

### Political Tensions

- **Neighboring Civilizations:** Border states test trade routes and levy penalties, waiting to see if Aurelia reforms or collapses.
- **Ruling Elite:** Splintered between charter advocates, cynical opportunists, and entrenched hardliners.
- **Religions:** Competing temples vie for legitimacy, each claiming stewardship of moral order.
- **Commoners and Former Slaves:** Organize to demand enforceable rights, forming coalitions that threaten elite dominance.
